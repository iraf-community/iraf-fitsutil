fxcopy.x
	Add local copy of ranges.x. The routines calls have now
	an 'l' preappended to get_netx_number() and decode_ranges()

	The to use these calls was to take advantage of the zero index
	support on this calls.
	Take the 'gz' support out.
	mar.4.98 nz

fxdelete.x
fxinsert.x
	Use the local copy of ranges that is in fxcopy.x
	mar.4.98 nz

        Version 1.0 released 4/98
==================================================================

fxrdhdr.x
fxfwrhdr.x
	Change the algorithm to skip extensions. Add new struct element
	MEF_KEEPXT. When 'yes', it will not touch the header extension
	and pass it to the output as is. Good for extracting extension
	as they are.
	aug.30.99 nz


fgread.c,fgwrite.c
	Added 2 new foreign task. There is a wrapper cl script for
	each to allow parameter editing before executing the C program.

	Version 1.2 release Sep99
====================================================================

fxheader.x
	This task can now list FITS files that do not have filename
	extensions; e.g. the file 'foof' exist and 'fxf foof' works
	OK now.

	You can omit the '.fits' extension now and the task would
	work ok for complex files names like: 'foo_n12.fhf.fits'.

	If the EXTNAME keyword is not located in within the first 36 cards
	then its value would not get displayed. This bug has been fixed
	now. Gemini files with MDF extension is one of this examples.
	nz 2 Oct 2003

===================================================================

mefendecode.x
	Put the lranges routines that where on pkg/fxfcopy.x to be
	available to user application via meflib.a

mefldhdr.x
	New routine. Load a FITS header from a file descriptor into a
	spool file.

mefget.x/mefgetb()
	add "errchk mef_findkw" to jump to the calling routine when
	an error has occurred. If the keyword does not exist should give
	and error rather than F.

==============================================================

catprhdr.x
	Revised  the code to make much simpler. Change mef_rdhdr.x
	to be a function now.  Jan.06.04

nhedit.x
        Added this temporary task until we put it somewhere else.

lib/cfitsio
ricepack.cl
funpack.cl
fpack.cl
	Added tasks to perform FITS tile compression layered on CFITSIO/fpack.
	Ricepack performs a streamlined tile compression using the Rice
	algorithm.  Funpack will unpack any general tile compressed file.
	Input/output can be uncompressed SIF or MEF FITS, IRAF .imh files,
	or gzipped FITS.  General fpack support will follow after ongoing
	CFITSIO development concludes, especially floating point support.

sum32.cl
sum32.c
checksum.c
	Added task to calculate FITS checksum.  This is also built into
	FITS tile compression.
