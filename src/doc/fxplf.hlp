DESCRIPTION
Fxplf will create a new BINTABLE extension on a new or existent FITS
file. The 'pl' data is located in the 'heap' area of the extension 
and the BINTABLE data consists of one entry with 2 integers. The first 
integer is the number of 16bits  integers  in the heap and the second
is the offset from the last BINTABLE data block.

If the output FITS file does not exist, a dummy primary FITS header is 
created before appending the BINTABLE extension.

EXAMPLES
1. To put together all of the Pixel list files starting with 'f'
into one new output FITS file.
